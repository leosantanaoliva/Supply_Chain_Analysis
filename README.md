# Supply_Chain_Analysis

## Excecutive summary 
In the competitive world of fashion and beauty, optimizing the supply chain is crucial to ensuring product availability, minimizing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. A Fashion and Beauty startup has accumulated a comprehensive dataset on the supply chain of Makeup products, covering various aspects from inventory management to shipping logistics. This project aims to leverage this data to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for cost reduction, improve stock availability, and streamline the supply chain operations.

## Business Problem
Despite having robust data on the supply chain, the startup faces challenges in:
- Inventory Management: Frequent stockouts and overstock situations lead to lost sales and increased holding costs.
- Shipping Efficiency: High shipping costs and inconsistent shipping times impact customer satisfaction and operational costs.
- Supplier Performance: Variability in supplier lead times and defect rates affect production schedules and product quality.
These issues collectively contribute to suboptimal performance in terms of cost management, inventory levels, and customer satisfaction. The challenge is to analyze the supply chain data to uncover root causes of these inefficiencies and provide actionable insights for improvement.
## Proposed solution 
Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, the following solution is proposed:
- Inventory Optimization Model:
Develop a predictive model using sales data, stock levels, and lead times to determine optimal reorder points and quantities. This model will help minimize stockouts and overstock situations by aligning inventory levels with actual demand.
- Shipping Cost and Efficiency Analysis:
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of shipping times, costs, and carrier performance. Use this data to negotiate better rates with carriers, optimize shipping routes, and establish more reliable shipping schedules, ultimately reducing costs and improving delivery times.
- Supplier Performance Dashboard:
Create a supplier performance dashboard in Tableau that tracks key metrics such as lead times, defect rates, and production volumes. This dashboard will provide visibility into supplier reliability, enabling better supplier management and decision-making.
- Integrated Data Management:
Implement a seamless data integration process using APIs to pull data from the ERP system into Snowflake. This will ensure real-time data availability for analysis and decision-making, improving the overall responsiveness of the supply chain operations.
## Methodology 
- Data Collection and Integration:
**Source**: Data will be collected from an ERP system via API and stored in Snowflake for comprehensive analysis.
**Features**: The dataset includes Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability, Sales Data, Shipping Details, Supplier Information, and more.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Clean the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Transform data to ensure itâ€™s in a suitable format for analysis.
- **Data Transformation Utilizing Kimball Methodology:**
  - **Approach**: Utilize the Kimball methodology for data transformation to structure the data into star schemas, optimizing it for efficient querying and reporting.
  - **Process**: Create fact tables for key metrics like sales, shipping costs, and inventory levels, and dimension tables for entities like products, customers, suppliers, and time.
  - **Outcome**: This will ensure a robust, scalable, and user-friendly data model that facilitates accurate and efficient analysis and reporting.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Inventory Optimization**: Analyze stock levels, order quantities, and sales data to develop models that predict optimal inventory levels and reorder points.
  - **Shipping Cost and Efficiency**: Evaluate shipping times, costs, and carriers to identify opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
  - **Supplier Performance**: Assess lead times, defect rates, and production volumes to evaluate supplier performance and its impact on the supply chain.
- **Visualization and Reporting**:
Tool: Use Tableau to create dashboards that visualize key metrics and trends, such as inventory turnover rates, shipping cost breakdowns, and supplier performance.
- **Actionable Insights**:
Provide recommendations based on analysis, including strategies for inventory management, cost reduction, and supplier performance improvements.
